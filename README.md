# Pong-Game
This is a classic Pong game in Python using the Turtle graphics library. It features two-player controls: left paddle with W/S keys, right paddle with Up/Down arrows. The ball bounces off walls and paddles, increasing speed with each hit. Scores are tracked and displayed at the top, with the ball resetting after each point.
