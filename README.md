# Pong-Game
This is a classic Pong game in Python using the Turtle graphics library. It features two-player controls: left paddle with W/S keys, right paddle with Up/Down arrows. The ball bounces off walls and paddles, increasing speed with each hit. Scores are tracked and displayed at the top, with the ball resetting after each point.


### Requirements
- Python 3.x

### Usage
- Left paddle controls: `W` (up), `S` (down)
- Right paddle controls: `Up Arrow` (up), `Down Arrow` (down)
- The ball bounces off the walls and paddles. Try to score by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.
